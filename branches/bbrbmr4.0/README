BBRBMR software:

/src
   	*.h *.cpp *.hpp files <-- for BBR software
	BMR/                  <-- other files used for BMR software
	tclap-1.0.5/          <-- third party code used for both BBR and BMR
      tnt_3.0.4/            <-- third party code used for BBR
	jama124src/           <-- third party code used for BBR  

/gcc
   contains the make file for BBRtrain BBRclassify BMRtrain BMRclassify
	<-- the PATH for jama, tnt and tclap need to be changed in the /gcc/Makefile

/msvc
  contains compile and link files for Windows
	<-- the PATH for jama, tnt and tclap need to be changed in the /msvc/*.rsp




#***************************************************
#     compile 
#***************************************************

To compile the software, run /gcc/Makefile if on Linux or Mac.
run /msvc/rebuilt.bat if on Windows.



#****************************************************
#      run
#****************************************************

After compilation, the four executables will be generated under /gcc or /msvc.
And they are: 
   BBRtrain:     binary model; 
   BBRclassify:  classify based on the binary model trained by BBRtrain;
   BMRtrain:     multi-class model;
   BMRclassify:  classify based on the multi-class model trained by BMRtrain.
